Recent development in high throughput microscopy(HTM) enables cell biologist to acquire images of cells in a large scale. This advances large-scale image-based assay/ screens. However, image analysis after HTM remains a big issue for cell biologist.

The purpose of this project is to explore few python libraries including numpy, scipy, scikit-image, mahotas, etc. for quantitative image analysis.

The current measurements includes:
  1. Line scan along spindle axis;
  2. Nuclear size measurement;
  3. 2D FISH chromosome count;
